### Commit Message Convention

This project uses [**Conventional Commits**](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated versioning and changelog generation via [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).

#### Commit Format

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Types

Use these commit types for Release Please to automatically detect changes:

- **`feat:`** - A new feature 
  ```bash
  git commit -m "feat: add Discord RPC integration"
  ```

- **`fix:`** - A bug fix 
  ```bash
  git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication timeout issue"
  ```

- **`chore:`** - Maintenance tasks, CI/CD, dependencies 
  ```bash
  git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
  git commit -m "chore(ci): update release workflow"
  ```

#### Breaking Changes

For breaking changes that require a major version bump (e.g., 1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0), add `BREAKING CHANGE:` in the commit body or use `!` after the type:

```bash
git commit -m "feat!: migrate to new API v2" -m "BREAKING CHANGE: requires new authentication flow"
```

### Workflow

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/bug-description
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit using conventional commits:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new statistics chart"
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feat/my-new-feature
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request** to the `main` branch

## üîÑ How Release Please Works

This project uses [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) for automated releases. Here's how it works:

### Automated Release Process

1. **Commit with Conventional Commits** - When you merge commits to `main` using the conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`)

2. **Release PR Creation** - Release Please automatically:
   - Analyzes commit messages since the last release
   - Determines the next version number based on semantic versioning:
     - `feat:` ‚Üí minor version bump (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
     - `fix:` ‚Üí patch version bump (1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
     - Breaking changes ‚Üí major version bump (1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
   - Creates/updates a Release PR with:
     - Updated `CHANGELOG.md`
     - Bumped version in `package.json`
     - Bumped version in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`

3. **Release PR Review** - The automatically created PR will show:
   - All changes since the last release
   - New version number
   - Updated changelog
   
4. **Merge to Release** - When the Release PR is merged to `main`:
   - A new GitHub Release is created with the version tag (e.g., `app-v1.2.0`)
   - The release workflow builds binaries for all platforms
   - Binaries are automatically uploaded to the S3 release bucket
   - The auto-updater manifest is updated for in-app updates
